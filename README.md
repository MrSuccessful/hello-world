Learning Something New
Hello, my name is Jake. I am here to learn as much as I can about programming, web design, and everything else that is available. I know a bit of Java, which I had a class in previously this year. I also know a bit of HTML and CSS which I took an online course in earlier this year. I am eager to learn more and have some fun!
